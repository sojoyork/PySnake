# Pysnake tutorial

First, let's clear some questions
- What is PySnake???
- ANSWER: Just a project to show how python will be if it was compiled and in order to make pythn better and faster!
Yea thats it :)

Now let's code in PySnake!!!
Here is a code in it
```
enjoy main() {
  print("Hello world!");
}
```

Now run it and you may see this output:
```
('main', [('print', '"Hello world!"')])
```

Now what is that? The AST lol :)
It is not a error but the "Hello world!" is at-least there!
