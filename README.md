# Pysnake
## discription
It is a programming langauge just made as a project AND made as a extennsio to python.

## features
- support to TOML: has support to TOML
- Is compiled: Yes, this programming language is compiled, it used to have compiled interperter which is like a interperter for a compiled lang but i scratched that idea and letted it get compiled by `.pyc` files.
-  A extension to python: Made for making python faster but not to replace it.

### Installation
If you need a test of this buggy language then copy this command:
```ssh
git clone https://github.com/sojoyork/PySnake.git
```
Then go to PySnake folder and type this code:
```pysnake
enjoy main() {
  print("Hello world");
}
```
save the file as you want but in the .pysn format.
Now run this:
```ssh
python pysn_compiler.py <input file>.pysn <output py file>.py <output folder>
```

Don't woory! The .py file will be converted into the .pyc in the output folder, this was done to fix bugs.
